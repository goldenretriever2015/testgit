new feature to develop in the local first, branch 1

This is a nice and clean way to work with git. I suggest you always proceed like this :

----A---B---C--     (REMOTE, master)

            |
            |       (Pull to local : `git pull origin master`)
            v

----A---B---C--     (LOCAL, master)

Then create a branch from your local master (git checkout -b branch1), work on it, commit your changes and push to remote :

----A---B---C------     (REMOTE, master)

----A---B---C---D--     (REMOTE, branch1)

               ^
               |
               |        (Push to remote : `git push origin branch1`)

----A---B---C------     (LOCAL, master)
             \
              D----     (LOCAL, branch1)

Then, when you're happy with your feature/fix/whatever, you can merge branch1 into master.
